# Light-gates
*Was* a simple arduino program for using 2 distance sensors to record a time and display it over the serial monitor
Still does that, but now uses the seeduino and 128x32 OLED i2c display, way more plug-n-play. This code can be used with almost any digital 
sensor, so long as the sensor reads high (1) on the input pins. you can change the logic failry easily to conform to what you have laying 
around.
